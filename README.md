Download the UI v5.spj file to import directly into squareline studios, that project will then be exported into Espressif-IDE.  

Copy over the "main" folder and all it's contents to the top level directory in Espressif-IDE, make sure to select COPY ALL along with OVERWRITE ALL.
Then copy over the partitions.csv file into the same top level directory.  

This should be rebuildable now and not give any issues.
